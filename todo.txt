Contents pg (still need to pass data.contents (course contents) via props) (alt: use accordions)
#how to place radio buttons in alert ###required for settings page
#modal for settings page (but changing values in modal doesnot modify selected option in Settings pg)
#edit page in weekly goal in MyLearning ####even after changing weeklyGoal still re-render does not occur
  //probably a comp re-renders only if a state declared within itself is changed
#video ,audio (different play,pause buttons)
#video , audio take time to load
#declaration: we have used copies of 'predefined sample data arrays' as data for each comp.
              so changes made to the data in each comp will not actually affect the remaining comps using the same data array
#create downloaded pg from settings comp
