need to make hiding menubar warnings free
Prob in contents, (still need to pass data.contents (course contents) via props) (alt: use accordions)

#CourseFilter in VerticalList
#need to update Profile,Settings
# in MenuBar2, clicking on search button should display a modal over the screens...in App.js...but not in the MenuBar2 itself
 ... it will simply push the Lists in Screen if we place it within the MenuBaar2
 (# EDIT: modal doesnot need to push any components ..it simply displays over other comps... SOLVED)

 CHANGES:
 -ScrollToTop in MenuBar for Home and MyLearning
 -Auto keypadOpen in modal of MenuBar2
 -Resolved height problems of FlatList/ScrollView in Contents,Overview,VerticalList
 -Close button of modal in List is now shifted to top-left
 -Resolved issue : 'when coming back from Course comp to MyLearning the menubar is highlighting Home button'
 -Resolved issue : 'when coming back from Course comp to VerticalList in Profile comp the menubar shows up' (Passed props to Course comp indicating that it was called by VerticalList and added an if statement at destruction useEffect code to ensure that the setShowMenu(true) did not occur if isVerticalList==true. Also removed a button which setShowMenu to true.
