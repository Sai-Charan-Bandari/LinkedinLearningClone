need to make hiding menubar warnings free
useScrollToTop() when clicked on menu bar again for the same screenOptions
Prob in contents, (still need to pass data.contents (course contents) via props) (alt: use accordions)
prob verticalList=>ListItem //problem : unable to display all elements => same problem in Overview
Close button of modal must be at top left of screenOptions
in modal in menuBar2 the TextInput needs to be focused automatically and keyboard must be displayed
# too many problems in course comp in overview and contents
#need to update Profile,Settings
#when coming out of a course in MyLearning the menubar is highlighting Home button
# in MenuBar2, clicking on search button should display a modal over the screens...in App.js...but not in the MenuBar2 itself
 ... it will simply push the Lists in Screen if we place it within the MenuBaar2
 (# EDIT: modal doesnot need to push any components ..it simply displays over other comps... SOLVED)
